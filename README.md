# Spring Boot Application

2019 State Farm Coding Competition

## Description

Create a Responsive Spring Application along with SQLite and Angular.JS. The purpose of this application is to interact with the backend framework Spring, in which users are able to create a sortable car list by adding their preferred car model from the web-client. In doing so, the backend database gets updated every time the car list gets modified. Tools used in this application include Java Spring Framework with Maven Support and SQLite relational database management for the backend and Angular.JS with Material UI for the front-end user interface. There is an added giphy support which displays an image of the car based on the name from the input.
